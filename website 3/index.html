        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and comes in many forms. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling system, while informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels that include early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. </p>

        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are disagreements about what the aims of education are and to what extent education is different from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. Fundamentally, education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">The end of illeteracy is here...!</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">One approach is to focus on a single overarching purpose of education and see the more specific aims as means to this end. Some identify the benefit to society through socialization as this purpose while others focus on the student and how education helps them lead a good life.Various scholars stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination.They state that mere indoctrination is only interested in instilling beliefs in the student.</p>
